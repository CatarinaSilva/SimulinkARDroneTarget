=====================

Deploy MATLAB Simulink model automatically to Parrot AR Drone with Embedded Coder C code generation

Tested in MATLAB r2014a and r2014b

To get started:

	1. install CodeSourcery toolchain
		Register here: http://www.mentor.com/
		Download Sourcery CodeBench Lite for ARM GNU/Linux here: https://sourcery.mentor.com/sgpp/lite/arm/portal/subscription?@template=lite

	2. cd in MATLAB into AR_Drone_Target folder and run install_script.m

	3. Pick ~\MentorGraphics\Sourcery_CodeBench_Lite_for_ARM_GNU_Linux\bin folder


We would also like to thank  Egoitz Martinez, Aimar Cordero Garcia and Asier Urcelay for providing us with the 3D VRML model of the AR Drone. Please contact this group on any questions related to the 3D model of the drone (Contact: egoitzml@gmail.com)
